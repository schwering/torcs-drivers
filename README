I've tried to stick with the code conventions of TORCS even though I
 * nowhere found them written down and
 * really don't like (politely expressed) and understand them
   (maybe there's some mutual cause?).

I had first started only writing less C-like C++ and complying with
Google's C++ conventions, but the code was so different to TORCS's
that it just looked horrible and wrapping the complete TORCS API
turned out to be more work I expected.

But besides that, writing a TORCS-robot is fun! :-)
