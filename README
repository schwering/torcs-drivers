A simple, non-competitive TORCS robot.

TRY IT OUT:
-----------
 $ cd torcs/src/drivers/chs

 # view / edit code

 $ make -C ../../../
 $ sudo make -C ../../../ install
 $ torcs

 # Race -> Quick Race -> Configure Race
 # choose any track (e.g. Forza) -> Accept
 # remove all players and add `chs' -> Accept
 # leave or change laps and/or race distance -> Accept -> New Race

 # let the bot drive and then termiante TORCS

 # the cDriver::initTrack() method wrote the file /tmp/track_points
 # which can be visualized using GNU Plot:

 $ ./gnuplot.sh

 # or

 $ gnuplot < gnuplot_text

 # if I remember correctly:
 #  * X axis is in meters of the track
 #  * Y axis is in meters, too, I think, i.e. if the graph starts at
      (0,0) and end at (3500,900), then Y = 900 means that in total we
      900m more in left turns than in right turns
 #  * positive slope means a left turn
 #    negative slope menas a right turn,
 #  * the greater the absolute slope, the sharper the bend
 #  * all data is with respect to the middle of the track



ARCHITECTURE:
-------------
The bot consists of some small subsystems, called `handlers' which register
themselves at a central unit and which are called in each loop.

CPP/H-FILE    | TYPE              | DESCRIPTION
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
chs           |                   | simply forwards everything to the driver
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
driver        | cDriver::cHandler | interface for subsystem that implement some
              |                   | car functionality
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
driver        | cDriver           | administrates and calls the the handlers
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
trackprofile  | cTrackProfile     | utility to sample the track structure at the
              |                   | beginning of the race
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
autothrottle  | cAutoThrottle     | naive handler that *tries* to control
              |                   | speed automatically using the track profile
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
transmission  | cTransmission     | automatic transmission
--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------
simpledriver  | cSimpleDriver     | simple, not-used driver

P.S.: The TORCS coding style sucks, to say the least.
      I tried to be compatible with the existing TORCS code, so
      my code looks weird, too.
